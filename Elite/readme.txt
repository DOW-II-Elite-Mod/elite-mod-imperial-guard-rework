This is the link to the new Imperial Guard Roster.
To see the changes click on the blue highlighted unit names and click on the hyperlink.
You are now getting forwarded to a Codex esque Blueprint.

How to install this?
Download the Data and Data-Attrib folder from this drive and the ucs file from discord.
The Data Attrib and Data Folder have to be unpacked (win.rar or 7zip)
Put those two folders into X:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Dawn of War II - Retribution\Elite.
If you already got those folders here you can savely override them without the need of a backup.

The UCS file are your tooltipps.
Those go into X:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Dawn of War II - Retribution\GameAssets\Locale\English.
!DISCLAIMER!: 
If you care about the live build tooltipps please make a backup of those beforehand.

Now locate your DOWELITE.config file in X:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Dawn of War II - Retribution and open it via txt editor.
change "dev: false" to "dev: true" and save it.
This allows you to play the test build.
Whenever you want to go back to the live build just open this file again and change "dev: true" back to "dev: false"

A lot of stats/ portraits and designs arent perfect yet and will get updated over time.
Main design quirk that we want to "fix" are the current Veterans.

If you have any questions feel free to notify the Elite Team members on discord.

Best of luck and good hunt
